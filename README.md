This repository contains information about the performance testing and monitoring certifications.   

I will try to keep this information up to date. But it is your responsibility to check the relevant official links before you register for the certification.

If you see a certification is no longer updated or retired, please submit a PR to improve this repo. Thank you!

***

<h3 align="center"><strong>The Purpose</strong></h3>

> The purpose of this repo is to give an idea about the performance testing certifications, not to impose. 

***

<h3 align="center"><strong>Points to remember</strong></h3>

> Learning multiple tools and getting certified will help you understand why one tool is not suited for some cases than the other. Earning certification doesn't mean that you know everything, please remember learning is an endless journey, never stop.  

> Happy Journey!
